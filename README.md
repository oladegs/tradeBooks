Used Bookstore Online :

Our group - Algorithm Avengers, is working together on a cool web app that's all about connecting book lovers â€” making it super simple for people to buy and sell books online. At the heart of our project are some key features: a smart system to handle user accounts, a catalog of books, order tracking, a wishlist to keep track of all your must-haves, and a shopping cart for easy purchases.

Our online bookstore isn't just about browsing books; it's fully interactive. You can add new books to sell, check out book details, update your listings, remove old ones, or just search for that perfect read, whether you're selling or buying. And don't worry about security; our user management system has got you covered, making sure that everyone's who they say they are and keeping all transactions safe and sound.
